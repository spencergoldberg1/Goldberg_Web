<h3>1. The data is retrained and evaluated on a random sample that is just 1 less than the total number of observations which helps better fit the model because of how the model is retrained on more data that it hasn’t seen which gives a better representation of the error for the whole dataset.</h3>

<h3>2. There might also be high variance since the testing data that is used is only on a single observation and doesn’t give a true evaluation of the whole dataset.</h3>
