<h1>Summary and Conclusions</h1>
<p>When I first started looking at the dataset it was immediately obvious that there were some variables that could be thrown out since they would just cause spurious results in the predicted distance of the flights. The variables that I first threw out were FlightDate, FlightNumber, and FlightDestination since these are all purely categorical data and would not help the model in prediction. I started by doing an exploratory data analysis by exploring each variable used in prediction and what first stuck out to me was that when I was looking at a box plot of each variable there was a big cluster of outliers in which the actual flight time was over 500 minutes so I removed all observances of that but also any canceled flight since they would not help in predicting how far the flight has traveled.</p>
<p>When I finally got to the model building stage I used a new data set that just uses the predictive variables that will help the model. The coefficients or betas outputted by the model will help find the y_hat or predicted flight distance. We can see when we fit the model that the standard error is 51.84. From this we can observe that the estimated distance traveled on each flight is off on average by about 52 miles. I also tried removing the scheduled flight time variable since it would be very similar to the actual flight time but it turned out that the standard error actually increased. This must be from the fact that decreasing the number of predictive variables will make the model less accurate since there is less information embedded inside the fitted model.</p>
