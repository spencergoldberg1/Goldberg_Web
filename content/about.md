My name is Spencer Goldberg and I am a Date Science student at Florida Atlantic University majoring in Data Analytics. I am currently interning for the Cocobolo Gorup as a software development intern. I am familiar in SwiftUI and Firebase backend databases by google. I am also experienced with Github collaboration and project development using the Jira project managment software.
