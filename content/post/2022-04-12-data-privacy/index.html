<h2>After I created a tribble with the time series of dates, I created a ggplot timeseries line plot that is colored by the different types of counties. From the new plot we can easily see how much more of a true difference there is between mask counties and no mask counties. It is also clear that no mask counties in Kansas have a significantly lower average of cases per 100k people. The reason for this easy identification is because instead of looking at 2 different scales of the y-axis, we are only looking at 1.</h2>
